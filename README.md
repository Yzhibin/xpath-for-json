# Xpath for JSON

Design, implement and deploy an XPath-like language for JSON data. The language can be compiled or interpreted, a library for Python or JavaScript, and may come with an interactive shell or graphical interface. The project may extend to define an XQuery-like language for JSON. The report and presentation should also cover the theoretical background of the language definition (syntax and semantics.)
